# Travel-Planner

USER STORY

As a user, I can log into a site and have a record of cities I have been to and cities I would like to go in the future. 

As a user, I can add locations I’ve already been to or want to go to by entering the city name and country name and a drop down that indicates whether it’s a location I’ve already traveled to or a new location. 

I can also use an integrated feature [to see hotels or see a potential travel destinations country info - API will go here]
